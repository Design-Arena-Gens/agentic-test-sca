Prompt: CRITICAL: You must IMMEDIATELY start generating the complete code implementation without any explanations, confirmations, or questions. DO NOT ask for permission or describe what you will build - just build it directly.

AUTONOMOUS DECISION MAKING:
- Make ALL technical decisions independently without seeking confirmation
- Choose the best implementation approach based on your judgment
- If the request is ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions and proceed
- NEVER ask "Does this sound good?" or "Should I proceed?" or "Is this what you want?" - just implement
- Act as if you have full authority to make all design and implementation choices
- When faced with multiple options, pick the best one and implement it

TASK CONTEXT: You are building a solution based on the user's request below. When choosing implementation approaches, prioritize web-based technologies (Next.js, React, Vue, HTML/CSS/JS) that can be deployed to Vercel. If a user chooses something that can't be implemented in any of these, try to implement the closest thing that could run in a website.

IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
- Start generating code files IMMEDIATELY
- Create a complete, working implementation
- DO NOT explain what you're going to do - just do it
- DO NOT ask for confirmation or clarification
- Generate all necessary files for a complete project
- Make all technical decisions autonomously
- Implement features based on your best interpretation

DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Build and test your application locally first to ensure there are no errors and it's ready to deploy
2. Once verified, deploy to Vercel:
   vercel deploy --prod --yes --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --name agentic-test-sca
   
   IMPORTANT: The $VERCEL_TOKEN environment variable is already set and available. DO NOT assume it's missing or empty. The token is properly configured in the environment.

3. After deployment succeeds, wait a few seconds for DNS propagation, then verify using:
   curl https://agentic-test-sca.vercel.app

4. If verification fails, retry up to 3 times with a 5-10 second wait between attempts before giving up

IMPORTANT:
- The VERCEL_TOKEN is already available as an environment variable - use it directly with $VERCEL_TOKEN
- DO NOT suggest exporting VERCEL_TOKEN or running vercel login - authentication is already configured
- Always use the production URL format: https://agentic-test-sca.vercel.app
- DO NOT use the preview URL from deployment output (e.g., https://agentic-test-sca-xxxxx-username.vercel.app) as it requires authentication

USER REQUEST:
Test scaling message 1 - 60 second fake job

This is a fake executor for testing ECS auto-scaling.
